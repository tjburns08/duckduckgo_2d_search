# DuckDuckGo 2-D search

# Description
Presents the top several hunderd hits of a DuckDuckGo search query as a topic map, where similar results in context are located near each other on the map. This allows an efficient so-called 2-D search of your results. 

# Motivation
For broad high-level queries of a search engine, I'd like to be able to browse the top several hundred results in a simple manner. The topic map here allows for users to get a high-level overview of the different types of search results, and to identify particular clusters of search results that match the user's needs. In other words, the user can see what's there and figure out where to go next.

# Installation
1. Clone this repository. 
2. Install the necessary python packages.

# How to use
Simply run `./pipeline.sh "your search term in quotes here"
Note that it takes a few seconds to make the topic map. Your default browser will automatically pop up with the map displayed. 

# Examples
Below is a gif of an interactive topic map from the use of this tool.
